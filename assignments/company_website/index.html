            <h3>What Is Our Goal?</h3>
            <p>Our goal is to create clay figurines that satisfy the imagination of every customer. We make sure to capture every detail of the character whether it's a real life creature or something out of your wildest dreams. Relentless hours are spent molding, smoothing, carving, and baking the clay to its perfection. </p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Our company was created in the year 2021. The idea arose when Jessica Jurewicz's mother realized that her talents with clay were exceptional. She proceeded to have Jessica teach the rest of her family how she mastered this seemingly effortless art. Money hungry, her mother trained the rest of the family members for hours on end until they also mastered the skill. The company was formed 24 hours later.</p>
